# Sticky Notes App

## Task Description

Write a simple public sticky notes (POST-IT notes) board.

Any visitor can post a sticky note on the board. Note must have a text on it, date when it was posted, and should display name of the author and gravatar image if itâ€™s available. User can choose the colour of the note.

Please, try to provide the best possible user experience, users would like to see how their note would look like on the board among others prior to saving it there.

Please, do your best while writing the code, imagine that you are going to deploy it to production as a part of large application, therefore you should apply all the disciplines and principles as for writing production code.
